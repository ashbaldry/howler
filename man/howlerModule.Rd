\title{Howler.js Module}
\usage{
howlerModuleUI(id, files, ..., width = "400px")

howlerModuleServer(id)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{ID to give to the namespace of the module. The howler player will have the ID \code{{id}-howler}.}

\item{files}{Files that will be used in the player. This can either be a single vector, or a list where different
formats of the same file are kept in each element of the list.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to send to \code{\link{howlerPlayer}}}

\item{width}{Width (in pixels) of the player. Defaults to 400px.}
}
\value{
The UI will provide a player with a play/pause button, previous and next buttons, duration information
and a volume slider.

The server-side module will return a list of reactive objects:
\describe{
\item{previous_track, play_pause,next_track}{Values tracking the pressing of the module buttons}
\item{playing}{Logical value whether or not the player is currently playing}
\item{track}{Name of the track currently loaded}
\item{duration}{Duration (in seconds) of the track currently loaded}
\item{seek}{Current position (in seconds) of the track currently loaded}
}
}
\description{
A simple module containing a howler player and a default set of howler buttons. The module also contains the
current position of the track being played and the duration of the track.
